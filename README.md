This project focuses on analyzing online shopping behavior of customers and predicting profit using data-driven techniques. With the increasing reliance on e-commerce platforms, understanding how customer actions translate into profitability has become a critical business requirement. The project uses historical online shopping data to study purchasing patterns, transaction behavior, and other relevant features that influence profit generation.

The dataset is first preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and prepare the data for analysis. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to uncover trends, relationships, and patterns between customer behavior and profit. These insights help in identifying the most influential factors affecting profitability in an online shopping environment.

After preprocessing and analysis, relevant features are selected and used to build a machine learning model where profit is treated as the target variable. The model is trained to learn patterns from historical data and predict profit values for new or unseen data. Model evaluation techniques are applied to assess performance and ensure reliability of predictions.

The outcome of this project includes both analytical insights into customer shopping behavior and a predictive model that can assist businesses in making informed decisions. By understanding which factors drive profit, organizations can improve marketing strategies, customer targeting, and overall operational efficiency in the e-commerce domain.
